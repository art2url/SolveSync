- **Secure Authorization:** OAuth 2.0 ensures your GitHub credentials are handled securely.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** JavaScript, Chrome Extensions API
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Axios, CORS
- **Authentication:** GitHub OAuth 2.0

   git clone https://github.com/art2url/solve-sync.git
   ```

2. **Load Extension in Chrome:**
